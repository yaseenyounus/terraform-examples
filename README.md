# Terraform Examples

Welcome to this GitHub repository containing Terraform code examples!

Here you will find a collection of Terraform code that can be used as a reference to create infrastructure as code (IaC) in your cloud environment. These code examples are designed to help you get started with Terraform and accelerate your infrastructure deployment process.

## Overview

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp. It allows you to define, deploy, and manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers, using a simple and declarative configuration language.
